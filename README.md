#homework0
This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]

My name is Mario Döbler, I'm a German exchange student at the NCTU and I'm from the University of Stuttgart. I'm an electrical engineering student and I'm specialising in signal processing and machine learning. I wrote my bachelor thesis about the topic "Second order optimization methods for RNN training", so I'm especially looking forward to the part about CNNs.

## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]

After my studies I would like to work/research in the field of autonomous driving, since it's a really challenging and recent topic and also the car industry in the region of Stuttgart is quite big. Furthermore I'm just in general interested in Computer Vision, e.g. I read an article about the Google Image Content Analysis which was really fascinating.

## What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]

I want to learn as much as possible about Computer Vision. But not only the theory, I also want to be able to apply my knowledge to real-life applications.

PS. 中文 or English are both fine.
